A tree is a good choice for showing the doctor's structure because it can represent how doctors report to 
each other. Each doctor can have people working under them, just like branches in a tree. This makes it 
easy to understand who manages whom and how the hospitalâ€™s management system is organized.

Each way of going through the tree (preorder, inorder, and postorder) is useful for different situations. 
Preorder traversal visits the main doctor first and then the others, which works well when information or 
decisions need to go from the top down. Inorder traversal goes from left to right and is useful when we want 
to see the doctors in an organized or sorted order. Postorder traversal visits the lower levels first, which 
helps when we need to review or remove people starting from the bottom of the structure.

Heaps are very useful for emergency situations because they help pick the most urgent patient first. In a 
hospital, doctors and nurses need to treat the most serious cases as soon as possible. A min-heap does this 
by keeping the patient with the highest priority (lowest urgency number) at the top. When a new patient 
arrives or one is treated, the heap automatically adjusts the order. This system helps the emergency room 
stay organized and ensures that the most critical patients always get attention first.
